# Simon Says Game 

In programming, the Simon Says game (or Simon game) is a memory and pattern-matching game where the user must repeat a sequence of actions (e.g., button presses, color flashes) generated by the program. The game starts with a short sequence, and with each successful repetition, the sequence becomes progressively longer and more complex. The game ends when the user makes a mistake or a time limit is reached
